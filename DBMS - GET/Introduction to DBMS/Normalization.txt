Normalization is a process used in database design to eliminate data redundancy and inconsistency by organizing data into structured tables. It involves breaking large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.
Normalization follows a series of steps called normal forms (NF):
1. First Normal Form (1NF)
Rules:
Each column must have atomic values.
Each row must have a unique identifier (Primary Key).
No repeating groups or multivalued attributes.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
Rules:
The table must be in 1NF.
Remove partial dependencies (non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key not part of it).

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
Rules:
The table must be in 2NF.
Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should depend only on the primary key not another non-key attribute).

4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Rules:
The table must be in 3NF.
Every determinant (a column that uniquely determines another column) must be a candidate key.
